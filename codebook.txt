The run_analysis.R script performs the following data preparation.

1. download the dataset.
	download from: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip  
	unzip in new directory folder "UCI HAR Dataset"

2. create each data frames, and name columns.
	activity <- activity_labels.txt : 6 rows, 2 columns
	# List of activities performed and its codes (labels)
	
	features <- features.txt : 561 rows, 2 columns
	# The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ.

	subject_test <- test/subject_test : 2947 rows, 1 column
	# data of subject in test set

	x_test <- test/X_test.txt : 2947 rows, 561 columns
	# measurement of test data set

	y_test <- test/y_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 columns
	# corresponding labels of test data set

	subject_train <- train/subject_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 column
	# data of subject in train set

	x_train <- train/X_train.txt : 7352 rows, 561 columns
	# measurement of train data set

	y_train <- rtrain/y_train.txt" : 7352 rows, 1 columns
	# corresponding labels of train data set

3.merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

	subject_merged <- rbind(subject_train, subject_test) : 10299 rows, 1 column
	x_merged <- rbind(x_train, x_test) : 10299 rows, 561 columns
	y_merged <- rbind(y_train, y_test) : 10299 rows, 1 column

	data_merged <- cbind(subject_merged, y_merged, x_merged) : 10299 rows, 563 column

4. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
	tidydata : 10299 rows, 88 columns
	# created by subsetting data_merged, selecting only columns: subject, code which contains "mean" and "std"

5. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
	tidydata$code is replaced by corresponding labels to each code in activity data frame.

6. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
	code column in tidydata renamed into activitiy
	All Acc in column name replaced by Accelerometer
	All Gyro in column name replaced by Gyroscope
	All BodyBody in column name replaced by Body
	All Mag in column name replaced by Magnitude
	All start with character f in column name replaced by Frequency
	All start with character t in column name replaced by Time
	All tBody in column name replaced by TimeBody
	All mean in column name replaced by Mean
	All std in column name replaced by STD
	All freq in column name replaced by Frequency
	All angle in column name replaced by Angle
	All gravity in column name replaced by Gravity

7. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
	newdata: 180 rows, 88 columns
	# created by taking the means of each variable for each activity and each subject
	# write new data set to newdata.txt
