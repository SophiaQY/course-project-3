discribes the variables, the data, and explain what procedures I did to manipulate the data to be clean and tidy

2.run_analysis.R
performs the fowllowing steps to achieve data cleaning and form a new dataset according to the requirement of the project:

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

3. newdata.txt is the final tidy data set generated.
